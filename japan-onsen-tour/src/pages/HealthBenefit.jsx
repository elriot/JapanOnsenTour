				Onsen have been enjoyed in Japan for centuries as a way to relax and
				heal.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
				If youâ€™re feeling tired physically or mentally, a warm soak in an
				onsen might be just what you need.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
				Being surrounded by quiet nature also helps calm your mind. After
				bathing, your body cools down naturally, which can lead to better,
				deeper sleep.
				</p>
				<p>
				Some onsen are also known for their beauty benefits. For example,
				silica can soften rough or dry skin, and sulfur-rich baths are often
				recommended for people with eczema or skin irritation.

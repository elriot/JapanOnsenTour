          Onsen have been enjoyed in Japan for centuries as a way to relax and
          heal.
        </p>
        <p className="p-gap">
          If youâ€™re feeling tired physically or mentally, a warm soak in an
          onsen might be just what you need.
        </p>
        <p className="p-gap">
          Being surrounded by quiet nature also helps calm your mind. After
          bathing, your body cools down naturally, which can lead to better,
          deeper sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some onsen are also known for their beauty benefits. For example,
          silica can soften rough or dry skin, and sulfur-rich baths are often
          recommended for people with eczema or skin irritation.

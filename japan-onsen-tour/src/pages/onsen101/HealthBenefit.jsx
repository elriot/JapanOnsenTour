					Onsen have been enjoyed in Japan for centuries as a way to relax and
					heal.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
					If youâ€™re feeling tired physically or mentally, a warm soak in an
					onsen might be just what you need.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
					Being surrounded by quiet nature also helps calm your mind. After
					bathing, your body cools down naturally, which can lead to better,
					deeper sleep.
					</p>
					<p>
					Some onsen are also known for their beauty benefits. For example,
					silica can soften rough or dry skin, and sulfur-rich baths are often
					recommended for people with eczema or skin irritation.
